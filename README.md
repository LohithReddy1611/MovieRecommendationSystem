** Movie Recommendation System**

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System, a comprehensive web application developed as part of our Problem-Solving and Full-Stack Development (PFSD) curriculum. Leveraging the power of Django, a high-level Python web framework, our project aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their viewing history and preferences.

This system utilizes a sophisticated algorithm that considers various factors, including user ratings, genres, and movie metadata, to suggest movies that users are likely to enjoy. Built with Django, this project showcases our ability to implement complex backend logic, RESTful APIs, and user-friendly web interfaces.
